FOR RECRUITERS
This repository contains a variety of projects that I am implementing

Some that you may find of particular interest are:
- Economic_Models/Multi_Agent_Market_Simulation
A high-frequency stock market environment populated by autonomous trading agents using various algorithmic strategies (including AI/ML-based ones). Studied emergent behavior of traders and assets over time. Includes custom C++ strategies, Python integration, real-time order matching, and portfolio tracking.

- Particle_Simulator/Clusters
A 2D particle simulator in C using Allegro5 with real-time rendering and support for thousands of interacting particles to simulate emergent artificial life. Optimized performance via spatial grid partitioning and multithreaded force calculations using OpenMP. Includes customizable interaction rules, wraparound boundaries, and live keyboard controls.
