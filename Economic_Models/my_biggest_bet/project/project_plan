🧭 Target Outcome
Land a Quant Developer Internship in Summer 2026 (Apply Fall 2025–Spring 2026).

🎯 What You Need to Be Competitive
A quant dev intern is typically expected to have:

Strong C++ skills
Familiarity with financial markets
Experience building high-performance systems
Evidence of projects that simulate or work with markets/trading
Knowledge of data structures, algorithms, and systems
Bonus: Understanding of probabilistic modeling, time series, and econometrics

🗓️ 12-Month Timeline (Starting June 2025)
🔹 June–August 2025 (Summer)
Goal: Complete C++, Build MVP of Market Simulator
📚 LearnCpp.com
✅ Finish chapters 12–20 (by July 31)
📌 Focus on pointers, dynamic allocation, inheritance, templates, and STL

💻 Project Work (Market Simulator):

Week 1–2: Design the class structure (Traders, Events, Stocks, Exchange, God)
Week 3–6: Build the core simulation loop (advance clock, generate events, simulate trades)
Week 7–8: Implement market matching, order book, logging

🔬 Optional: Add volatility, correlated stocks, and industry-based news

Deliverables:
GitHub repo with code and README
Blog post or Medium article explaining architecture and lessons learned

🔹 September–December 2025 (Fall Semester)
Goal: Learn Quant Skills, Add Complexity to Simulator, Apply for Internships

📘 Courses:
Take a course in Financial Engineering / Econometrics / Time Series if available

📈 Market Simulator Enhancements:
Add basic strategy bots (mean reversion, momentum, arbitrage)
Add crash events, sectoral shocks, and positive/negative news
Add asynchronous messaging (prep for future networked architecture)

🧮 Quant Prep:
Start reading "Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives" by John Hull
Work through Khan Academy or QuantStart tutorials on stochastic calculus and Monte Carlo

🎯 Internship Applications:
Prepare resume tailored for quant dev (highlight market simulator, C++, stats)
Start applying in September to top quant firms (Jane Street, HRT, IMC, SIG, etc.)

🔹 January–April 2026 (Spring Semester)
Goal: Refine C++ Skills, Work on System Performance, Interview

📚 Advanced C++
Learn memory models, RAII, smart pointers, multi-threading
Consider "Effective Modern C++" by Scott Meyers

🚀 Project Optimization:
Profile and optimize simulation (memory, execution time)
Add concurrency (multi-threaded matching engine or trader execution)

🧠 Mock Interviews:
Leetcode: focus on hard-level C++, data structures
System design interviews: simulate exchange, low-latency systems
Quant interviews: brainteasers, math puzzles, probability

🔹 May–June 2026
Goal: Final Push, Accept Offer
Accept internship offers (hopefully multiple!)
Reflect and package project for future portfolio use
Consider publishing your simulator as a GitHub open-source repo for others to build on

📌 Additional Recommendations

Add Quant Keywords to Resume:
Highlight C++ prominently
Add specific terminology: “market simulation,” “order book,” “high-frequency,” “trading strategies,” etc.
Emphasize your work with numerical methods, probability, and optimization

Mock Trading Strategies:
Implement Sharpe ratio, moving averages, VWAP, RSI
Simulate basic trading strategies and report PnL

Resources:
Books: “Inside the Black Box” by Rishi Narang, “Algorithmic Trading” by Ernest Chan
Courses: Coursera’s “Computational Investing” or QuantInsti’s free resources























Define the outcome:
Make a market where different bots trade with each other.
A free stock market with multiple play. 
Each stock will have different data. 

-- Optionally implement News, Crash in market, diff attr of stock. 

- Financial Stmnt -Ticker -Price -Volume traded -NumStocks -Historical -Industry
- Events positive/negative impact probability percentage impact
- Correllated with other stocks

Five Classes:
  Traders(submit trades), 
  Events(impact stocks), 
  Stocks(valuation of stocks), 
  God(creates events), 
  Exchange(enables exchange between traders)

Make the architecture:
There weill be a single-process arichitecture. (May later extend to client-server TCP)
One simulation loop"
1.  Advance Time (with clock)
2.  Generate Events (God)
      Events impact stock valuations.
3.  Traders Make Decisions.               (Traders are forced to sell after 7 clock cycles to prevent hoarding, -- fix later, or add a LOT of 'human' traders with slightly random behaviors)
      Traders each submit buy/sell orders
4. Exchange Matches the orders.
5. Log the history and update the state
6. Repeat

Events map onto different stocks differently. 
-   Positive V Negative
-   Adv  or disadv compared to industry
-   Shock Events (trigger buy or sell of stocks by intitutions, and have massive stock price chages)   



Traders:
-   Submit trades based on stock data, and they can store their own previous trades.
-   The exchange asynchronously sends each trader the stock_frame
-  This stock frame encapsulates the data of all the stocks currently within the market
-   Traders can thus use this snapshot to make trades based on some strategy.



Make a plan:
